# FindInFiles

I couldn't find any simple tool for searching files containing given text..<br>
(Notepad++ crashed with blue screen, VisualStudio is too much, Atom is too slow to start, Windows content: search is super slow, Googling didn't return any simple free tools..etc), so had to make one :/<br>
<br>
Still work-in-progress (but usable already)

### Alternatives
- https://github.com/unitycoder/FindInFiles/wiki/Existing-Find-In-Files-Tools

## Current Features
- Search text in files from given folder (and subfolders)
- Can be launched from Commandline or Explorer context menu (to automatically pass target folder)
- Double click results to open file in default editor
- Save search history (to search again easily)
- Resizeable window

## Planned Features
- Jump to line (if you are using notepad++ or others that support linenumber parameter)
- Sort results by modified file date
- Settings to allow modifying searched file extensions
- More? You can comment using issues here^
